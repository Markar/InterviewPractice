**What is your greatest strength?**
Collaboration
I work hard to understand what problems folks both on my team and on other teams are facing, so we can get rid of blockers and move cross-team work forward. 

**What is your greatest weakness?**
Process management
I've worked at small companies with very little process management that move fast, and large companies with thorough process management that move slowly, but I find the middle group more difficult to manage. In an effort to get better, I've been working to learn the basics of product management myself so I can help guide the direction for my team. 

**Tell me about a time you showed leadership.**
I joined TPCi as the only web developer on a platform team, with no producer or any other resources. I worked with the manager who hired me to create a plan for the resources I needed to be successful on the project. I asked for help from a UX designer, a dev ops engineer I could work with, a contact for the platform endpoints to use in my project, a producer, and another more junior web developer to work with. This resulted in eventually launching the application successfully for the support and account management agents to use well ahead of the earliest beta window, and full functionality by the Canadian release window. 

**What would your co-workers say about you?** 
I think my coworkers would mention my ability to improve the stability of a codebase through refactoring and adding test coverage. I have a strong preference for simplifying code and making it easier and quicker for developers to understand. 

**Describe your most challenging project.**
The Virtual Data Rooms project I developed for ShareFile.
I was early in my career and working for a startup without much support and it had a large impact on the business, resulting in a huge new revenue stream that helped us get acquired. The projct involved writing a .Net console application that would run on AWS, pulling items from a queue and converting them from office file types to pdfs, adding watermarks, and generating thumbnails and previews for the files to be used in the browser. I've done more difficult work since then, but have been in a much better position to do the work, and have had more support as well. 

**Tell me about something youâ€™ve accomplished that you are proud of.**
I made a web game using PhaserjS. I went through many iterations, gathered feedback from the gaming community on Reddit, and played it online with friends. 

**Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a coworker who was behind schedule on a joint project? How did you handle the situation?**
I've had this situation come up occasionally in strict agile environments. Typically, if the coworker is on my team, I try help move resources around to take the pressure off so we all get our work done. If the person is an outside dependency, I try to figure out how I can help them stay on schedule. If there's nothing I can do, I try to ease the pressure by reducing the scope and moving work to a future sprint.

**Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker. What did you do to resolve the situation?**
Several times I've run into situations where another developer wants to write code to be as concise as possible, which I think goes against best practices of trying to improve readability of code. Writing concise code can be uesful in particular situations, but most of the time readability should be prioritized. New eningeers will be coming and going, and anything you can do to make learning the code base easier and faster is worthwhile.
