## Stages
# Preliminary analysis
- Conduct preliminary analysis: Identify the organization's objectives and define the nature and scope of the project. Ensure   that the project fits with the objectives.
- Consider alternative solutions: Alternatives may come from interviewing employees, clients, suppliers, and consultants, as well as competitive analysis.
- Cost-benefit analysis: Analyze the costs and benefits of the project.

# Requirement analysis
- Collect facts: Obtain end-user requirements by document review, client interviews, observation, and questionnaires.
- Scrutinize existing system(s): Identify pros and cons.
- Analyze the proposed system: Find solutions to issues and prepare specifications, incorporating appropriate user proposals.
    

# Design
- Desired features and operations are detailed, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode, and other deliverables.

# Development

# Integration and Testing
- Assemble the modules in a testing environment. Check for errors, bugs, and interoperability.

# Implementation
- Put the system into production. This may involve training users, deploying hardware, and loading information from the prior system.

# Documentation
- Write documentation for the feature work. Code should be documented along the way. 

# Evaluation
- The system and the process are reviewed. Relevant questions include whether the newly implemented system meets requirements and achieves project goals, whether the system is usable, reliable/available, properly scaled and fault-tolerant. Process checks include review of timelines and expenses, as well as user acceptance
