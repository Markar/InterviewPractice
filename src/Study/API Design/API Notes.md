GET /articles/ for getting news articles
POST /articles/ is for adding a new article
PUT /articles/:id is for updating the article with the given id. 
DELETE /articles/:id is for deleting an existing article with the given ID.

GET /articles/:articleId/comments for getting comments for article X

For example, suppose you wanted to return the author of particular comments. You could use /articles/:articleId/comments/:commentId/author. But thatâ€™s getting out of hand. Instead, return the URI for that particular user within the JSON response instead:

"author": "/users/:userId"

Articles
{ ArticleId, Header, Body, Footer }

Comments
{ ArticleId, Comments (JSON or junction table)}

GET /articles/:articleId/comments for getting comments for article X
