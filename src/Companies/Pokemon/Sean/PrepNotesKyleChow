LRU pokemon trainer belt
configurable size

Write some Python code that models a Pokémon Trainer Belt. Try to find a new way of determining what happens when you catch a Pokémon. Normally the new Pokémon will be sent to storage if the belt is full. Instead, add it to the belt and send the Pokémon least recently battled with and/or caught to storage.
