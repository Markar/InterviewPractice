## Core Values

### Passion for Pokemon

- I started playing Pokemon with the original gameboy games
- I'm trying to come back, after making a very poor financial decision just to work for Pokemon again

### Dedicated to Quality

- Worked with vendors to resolve performance issue with VMs
- I worked to set up good tests for the frontend and the middle tier for Stadium.
- I started the initiative for testing at PayScale.
- Set up feature flagging

### Challenging the Expected

- Served as a PM, vouching for Stadium and my team
- I worked with other team's producers to make Stadium useful to them, aside from the original goal of serving as the live ops tool.

### Building Relationships

- Built relationships with the external vendors
- Built relationships within GSB to get people to use Stadium (Client, Test, Support, Server devs)
- Relationships with other dev teams, to get them onboard with Stadium
- Worked with PMs to help with their tasks

### Integrity and Respect

- "Don't judge someoen by their lowest moment"
- Figure out what's going on with other people in their lives, help them.
- Allies are an asset in any environment, and that starts with integrity and respect.

### Delighting Customers

- Gathering feedback every week, demoing the product
- Incorporating small bonuses, like UX improvement, artwork, loading animations, favicons
- Prompt bug fixes, only scheduled downtime
- I worked on a piece of Stadium to send in-game content so our testers and devs could test easier.
- I developed a page for PTV so they could debug user reported issues easier by looking at play history for individual accounts.
