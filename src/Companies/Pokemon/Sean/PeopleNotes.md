### Likely Questions

When were you a dissenting voice in a conversation?

- When I was working with Colin, he was focused on getting us to 100% code coverage at any costs, including writing snapshot tests. I don't believe believe snapshot tests were valid for the code we were writing, and that we should focus on writing valuable tests that catch issues.

How do you remove biases in solution for a problem?

- I always ask ask for feedback on an intended solution for a problem so I don't go into something based only on my experience. I value everyone's experience from past jobs, and our field is too complex to ever think I will always know best.

How do you encourage teams to incorporate diverse perspectives?

- I try to remind people that everyone is there for the right reasons - working for Pokemon and trying to make the audience excited for the brand. Sometimes there's a lot of friction between teams that are trying to work together, and the best thing to do is let cooler heads prevail.

Share a time where you had a difficult relationship with someone

- I had a difficult relationship with a previous manager, where he would make snarky comments during our roundtables every day, picking on individuals. This created a general culture in the engineering group that people should grumble about their work and make fun of each other. In my one on one I shared my thoughts that even though it may be fun in the moment, it's creating a bad culture for the team because people mimic the leader.

When have you held up a release for quality standards?

- I've mostly held up releases for refactoring issues. For individual features, I think feature flags are sufficient, but when you do a large refactor like converting an app to Typescript, or building a new version of an app using more modern tech, it's hard to estimate the timeline and important to delay the release to make sure there are no interruptions for the customer.

### Core Values

Passion for Pokemon

- I started playing Pokemon with the original gameboy games
- I'm trying to come back, after making a very poor financial decision just to work for Pokemon again

Dedicated to Quality

- For Stadium, I worked with the customers (external vendors) to resolve a performance issue they were having that I couldn't reproduce locally. This involved getting one of their VMs to work in, learning about web workers and optimizing the app to work for very low spec machines.
- I worked to set up good tests for the frontend and the middle tier for Stadium.
- I started the initiative for testing at PayScale.
- I've set up feature flagging (old school LaunchDarkly) so I could make sure each feature was fully testing and up to quality standards before releasing it

Challenging the Expected

- I joined the server team to work on a web application to mirror the DWD system ahead of the beta launch. Without a PM, I had to advocate for my product getting into other team meetings to take on additional features.
- I worked with other team's producers to make Stadium useful to them, aside from the original goal of serving as the live ops tool.

Building Relationships

- To drum up more internal work for Stadium, I built up good relationships with all of the other teams inside GSB, and a good amount of people outside of GSB. I also worked extensively with external vendors, and helped bring a lot of these folks into the fold at the server team in general.
- I want to bring my relationships with other teams and products into this team. I think an integration with Stadium in particular would be really valuable, and I have the knowledge to make that successful.

Integrity and Respect

- There's a quote from Ted Lasso that resonates well with me, "Don't judge someone by their lowest moment". I try to live this idea, giving people the benefit of the doubt rather than trying to get them in trouble. If someone is struggling, I try to figure out what's going on in their lives and how I can help them at work.
- I think allies are the strongest asset in a work place, and you have to start with integrity and respect.

Delighting Customers

- At TPCi most of my customers were internal folks and vendors, but I enjoyed gathering feedback from people every week, demoing as often as I could, implementing bugfixes as soon as possible, and delivering unexpected features and UI.
- I worked on a piece of Stadium to send in-game content so our testers and devs could test easier.
- I developed a page for PTV so they could debug user reported issues easier by looking at play history for individual accounts.
