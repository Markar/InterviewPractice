Interview went well

Hope your week has gone well! I circled up with our team yesterday, and they let me know that they have, unfortunately, decided to move forward with additional candidates for our FE role. We thought your experience was awesome and enjoyed the calls, but we have a set of candidates whose previous work aligns very closely with what we're working on currently. 

I've really enjoyed our conversation, and am wishing you the best of luck in your search. Please use me as a resource if I can help in any way! Always happy to make connections or intros if I'm connected to anyone you're interested in speaking to. Let's stay in touch!
