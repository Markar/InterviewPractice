# Clockwise Matrix
Write a function that, given a matrix of integers, builds a string with the entries of that matrix appended in clockwise order.

String matrix(int[][] input)
For instance, the 3x4 matrix below:
2, 3, 4, 8
5, 7, 9, 12
1, 0, 6, 10
would make the string “2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 10, 6, 0, 1, 5, 7, 9”.

How can you verify that your solution is correct?
- I would write unit tests to cover edge cases for acceptable expected output.

Please Approximate the time that it takes to solve each question. 
- 60-90 minutes (without referencing code online)
# Assumptions
- Language agnostic
- Global state is okay
- Helper functions are okay
- Matrix is going to be "proper", with same number of elements on each row

# Notes
I wrote my solution on the airplane and just realized that there was a method signature provided that might invalidate my solution. I wrote my solution using JS since that's the primary language I develop in, which involves a couple of functions split out for complexity and a global "result" state. 

If you want me to write a solution using a specific language, or to avoid using recursion, or to avoid global state, let me know and I can work on another solution.
