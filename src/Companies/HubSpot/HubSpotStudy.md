# General
<!-- - What is an Index
  - An index is a tool used in the background of a database to speed up querying. The key is indexed by default, but
    you can specify columns as well. 
    CREATE INDEX customers_by_phone
    ON customers (phone_number)

- What is a partition key
  - Partition key: A simple primary key, composed of one attribute known as the partition key. Attributes in DynamoDB are similar in many ways to fields or columns in other database systems. 
  - This is used to know which partition to query for the desired data -->

# JS
- Standard JS coding questions, scopes, binding, currying, memoization...

- some algorithmic questions, nothing super complicated, look at LeetCode page 1

- Write a function that takes a string of characters and an integer n and returns the most frequent n-gram. Example: for ‘abcdabxe’ and 2 returns ‘ab’. If there are more than one with the same frequency, return the first one you encountered.
  - Modify this to return the most frequent one.

- Given an array of integers and a number n, return true/false if there is a pair that sums to that number.
  - Variant - return all possible combination that adds up to the target

- Add commas in-between each character of a string. Do this in such a way so that I could execute: 'hello'.addCommas()

- Enhance a simple pseudo-tweet application. You should be able to add tweets and remove tweets. It should also look relatively pretty.

- Given an input string S, and an input number X, which X letters were repeating more in S.

- Return lowest or highest n elements in order of two sorted arrays.

# Design
- Design question. Design a weather widget that pull data from a meteo service API which makes data available every hour. Then avoid pulling the data from it all the time if there are no changes. Then what happens when you scale this to lots of users.

- Design a url shortener service.
  - How would you improve performance under high load?

- If you had to design a twitter clone application from scratch, how would you go about it?

- Design Database for Facebook News Feed with the database of your choice.

- Design a Bit.ly service with database of your choice.

# DB
- DB questions. Social network with Person and Friendship and Post and how would you represent this. How would you write a query for the wall? How would you do infinite scrolling? Questions about how indexes work, which index would you create for this or that query etc.


# Behavior
- Describe a time you were behind on a deadline.  Find a way to connect it to the team, etc.
  - When I was working as a consultant at IVC, I had a tricky project that involved rewriting a mobile app that
  connected to an existing .Net backend. Figuring out the scope of an inherited codebase can be pretty tricky, and 
  by the time I realized how much work there would be to get the new app running, I had to bring it up with my boss
  to come up with contingency plans. In the end, I was able to pull some additional resources from the company to help 
  meet the deadline, including my boss, and we were able to deliver on time. I learned a lot about how to evaluate the 
  scope of a project and to ask for help early on.

- Describe someone you worked with who you admire
  - I've worked with many great folks, but an early manager and mentor for me Shawn Miller really
  stands out. He built a great team culture and really stood up for his team, while continuing to 
  have good knowledge about the code, and making sure we all had a good work/life balance. I learned a 
  lot from him about loyalty and how important soft skills are for a team. 

- Why you want to leave your current job
  - I'm moving to NC and can not continue with my current role after they return to office fully. 

- Tell me about a time you were frustrated and what did you do to deal with that
  - I had a frustrating experience at TPCi with a revolving door of producers, which made it difficult to gather
    requirements, prioritize work, and get feedback on my work. My task was to figure out how to communicate up the
    chain that my team needed to have a more stable producer so we could do our best work. I talked with the manager 
    for production and the director, and made a case for why our small team would benefit from a full-time producer 
    managed to help them make a case for head count.

- How do you approach learning a new framework/technology
  - I usually go to frontendmasters.com and look for a video on the technology, then I like to start 
    up a new sample project to play with it in my free time. 

- Tell me about a time you screwed up

- How do you prioritize work - We favor autonomy and take ownership
  - Usually this is up to the PM, but when I have to prioritize work I focus on my customers first. If there are 
  multiple groups, like sales, marketing, and support for example, then I prioritize the folks who will be impacted 
  most in their jobs first.

- Tell me about a time when you faced conflict at work
  - We believe our best perk is amazing people (Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable, Transparent
  - Earn someone's trust. )

- What is your greatest strength and weakness  
  - I think my greatest strength is making connections with people. I build strong bonds with my teammates that last
  beyond the job, and I think that makes the work environment much more fun and productive. This also helps in remote
  environments where it is easy to operate in silos. 
  - My greatest weakness is probably organization skills, but this is where working with a good PM makes such a big 
  difference. I'm not inherently very organized and great at keeping track of tasks and updating everyone consistently.

- Tell me about a time you failed, and what you learned. Connect to a person, why was it important to a person, how did you grow
  - While working as a consultant for IVC, I failed to properly scope the amount of work involved in refactoring an inherited code
  base. There only point of contact for the codebase was reluctant to work with me and the code structure was very different from what
  I was used to in .Net. I learned that I need to go into more detail when scoping projects, accounting more for limited availability 
  in support, as well as time to learn the variations on code.
